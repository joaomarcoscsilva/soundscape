# Semi-supervised Soundscape Ecology

This repository contains code for applying Semi-Supervised Deep Learning methods to the [Soundscape Ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape_ecology) problem. In particular, we use Deep Neural Networks to detect and classify species from audio recordings from the brazilian [Atlantic Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_forest).

## Dataset

The dataset used was provided by researchers from the [Laboratory of Spatial Ecology and Conservation (LEEC)](https://leec.eco.br/) at the [SÃ£o Paulo State University](https://unesp.br/).
